# Contributing to LockedSociety

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to [LockedSociety](LockedSociety.github.io) These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


 ### **Did you find a bug?**
 ___

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
___
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the contributing guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
___

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of LockedSociety will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* Suggest your change to the developers and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

**LockedSociety** is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks!
